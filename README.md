# Responsive HTML Tables
Responsive tables - automatically shift headers to the side and stack - works great with UIKit, but will work with any other CSS framework easily too.

Will automatically stack columns with headers converted to captions. Add a data-label to th elements to over-ride the caption globally, or add a data-label element to the td row elements to over-ride individual rows.
