# Responsive HTML Tables
Clever responsive tables - automatically shift headers to the side and stack - works great with UIKit

Will automatically stack columns with headers converted to captions. Add a data-label to th elements to over-ride the caption globally, or add a data-label element to the td row elements to over-ride individual rows.
